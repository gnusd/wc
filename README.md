## WC go - a wordcount implementation in go


### Problems encountered 

I'm trying to learn go and started with writing an implementation of the Unix program wc. I've struggled with getting the character count to correspond with the character count in Unix wc. I think it's a problem with the *newline*, but I'm not sure. I've looked at other implementations of wc program written in go and haven't figured out what's wrong. I'll keep trying to figure it out.


### Useage 

I use the classic Unix wc flags


``` bash
-l Print the newline counts

-c Print the byte counts

-m Print the character counts

-w Print the word counts

-L Print the maximum display width

```
