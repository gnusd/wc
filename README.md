# WC go - a wordcount implementation in go

I'm trying to learn go and started with writing an implementation of the Unix program wc

## Use

Classic wc flags

-l prints how many lines 

-c print how many bytes

-m prints how many charachters

-w prints how many words


-p prints out the title and values one per line
